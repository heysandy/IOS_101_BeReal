# Project 2 – BeReal Clone

Submitted by: **Gorakh Khatri**

**BeReal Clone** is an iOS app inspired by BeReal that allows users to sign up, log in, and share photo posts with optional captions. Users can view a feed of posts from all users after logging in and can log out securely. The app uses Parse as a backend for user authentication and data storage.

Time spent: **10–12 hours** spent in total

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app included:
- Configuring Parse correctly with Xcode and managing user sessions
- Debugging Info.plist and project configuration issues
- Understanding Git and GitHub workflows when reorganizing project files
- Managing image uploads and asynchronous loading in the feed

These challenges helped improve my understanding of iOS project structure, backend integration, and source control.
